MinDos is a system or a "suite" for the program Rainmeter. (https://www.rainmeter.net)

Basically, rainmeter places objects on your background which you can interact with in various ways.
Look further down for details on what each part / gadget of MinDos does.

This is my personal project that i have been working on, on and off, for the past year or so.
I usually take requests to gain experience, but i decided that i had learned enough to bring something of my own to this world now :)





Here's the info for MinDos' gadgets: 

** Launcher
- Intermediate complexity 'game' launcher which is easily configurable
- It is still a work in progress, since i want it to be able to launch different sets of programs.
Visual: It is a round object, also known as a Vigor Menu to some, which i have edited to fit my needs :)


** MusicuIsLifu (WIP)
- Fetcher of currently playing song from 3 different apps, VLC, Hyper and Clouder!
- I write WIP beside it's name because it is really.. really.. a Work in progress.
  I have a lot of work to do on this one, but i have more important things to do for now :)
  
  
** PCInfo
- Simple displayer of CPU and RAM usage by your computer.
Visual: This gadget contains 2 versions. 
        MinPCInfo is the newest, which fits perfectly at the center of the Visualizer.

		
** TimeFlow
- Displayer of current time, features 2 versions.
1. TimeFlow: Analog clock with ability to display digital time in center. 12 or 24 hour mode configurable.
2. Neon TimeFlow: Digital Clock with a fancy neon look to it. It is also able to display 12 or 24 hour time.


** Visualizer
- Start it up and put some music on ;)
- Then scroll down on the visualizer's area and play around with the colors and images until you feel satisfied.
Visual: A visualizer is an image that moves / changes based on music playing. This one is just very nice. :D


** Weather (WIP)
- Fetcher of current weather in your city / area.
- Features 2 versions.
1. Weather: Simple collapsible box that displays temperature, condition and humidity.
2. MinWeather: "Minimal" displayer of weather, condition and wind speeds.


** MoodSettler
- Tired of looking for a good theme for your MinDos?
- Simply scroll down on the "button summoner" in the lower-right corner of your screen to summon MoodSettler.
  Then all you have to do is choose the one that settles your mood! 


** Geenie 
- Right-click on the "button summoner" in the lower-right corner of your screen and then type your wish! :)
  (Only works if the smaller buttons are not summoned)
- Basically, geenie is your shortcut to MinDos.

  Dont want to bring forth the theme changer? 
  Remember the name of the theme you like? 
  Just type its name, or the first 2 letters of it, and it'll happen! :)
  Example: DarkPowers can be summoned by typing Da, Dp or Dark and then hitting enter. Simple as that!
  (Same thing with gadgets, we = Weather, PC = PCInfo, etc.)
  
  GENERAL TIP:
To configure the different gadgets, simply scroll down while hovering over them to summon their configure menu :)
