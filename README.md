MinDos is a system or a "suite" for the program Rainmeter. (https://www.rainmeter.net)

The program works like this:  
Rainmeter creates "objects" on top of your wallpaper which you can interact with in various ways.  
Look further down for details on what each part / gadget of MinDos does.

This is my personal project that i have been working on, on and off, for the past year or so.  
I usually take requests, but this one was not a request. 

This is a creation of my moments of inspiration.

It is my passion to work on MinDos, and rainmeter in general.

Thank you very much for your continued support and feedback! :)

  There is currently 6 basic themes.

  
**Geenie**

  (Only works if the smaller buttons are not summoned)

  Dont want to bring forth the theme changer?   
  Remember the name of the theme you like?  
  Just type its name, or the first 2 letters of it, and it'll happen! :)  
  Example: DarkPowers can be summoned by typing Da, Dp or Dark and then hitting enter. Simple as that!  
  (Same thing with gadgets, we = Weather, PC = PCInfo, etc.)

- Intermediate complexity 'game' launcher which is easily configurable.  
- It is still a work in progress, since i want it to be able to launch different sets of programs.

**MusicuIsLifu (WIP)**
- Fetcher of currently playing song from 3 different apps, VLC, Hyper and Clouder!  
- I write WIP beside it's name because it is really.. really.. a Work in progress.  
  I have a lot of work to do on this one, but i have more important things to do for now :)
