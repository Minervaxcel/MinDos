Hey there!

Since you're looking here, i'm guessing you are looking to find out if MinDos will be able to fetch data from your specific media player..

If that's the case, i'm a genius and you are just an object in my game.

jk, i'm just not that kind of guy. xD

Too stoned for this. 
But. Feel free to write me the name of your media player and i will work on a fetcher for it asap :)
